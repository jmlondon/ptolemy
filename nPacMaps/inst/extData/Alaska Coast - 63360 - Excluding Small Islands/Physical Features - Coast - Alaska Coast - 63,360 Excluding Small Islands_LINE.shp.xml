      <abstract>Similar to the coast63 coverage, the cst63xsi excludes the small
islands that are difficult to visually map at 1:1,000,000
(area &lt; 500,000 square meters).  This  provides a smaller data file
to work with, particularly for clipping general coverages
and for general small scale mapping, while not compromising the
consistency between it and the coast63.

The Abstract from the coast63 coverage is as follows:
This is a first cut at a statewide 1:63,360 coastline.  The
entire coasline, however, is not 1:63.360; only where data was
available as of January 1998.  It is a mixture of sources ranging
from the Department of Natural Resources, Land Records Information
Section hydrography database to the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill
Environmentally Sensitive Index coastline (no ESI attributes included)
to the US Geologic Survey hydrography to US Forest Service (in Prince
William Sound).  Where the 1:63,360 data was unavailable the 1:250,000
coastline was used to fill in.

This information does not include lakes or streams.  All streams are
cut off at the mouth with a straight line.</abstract>
      <purpose>The purpose of this information is to provide a better coastline for land
data to be clipped.  It's purpose is cartographic.  Before this was created,
land data was clipped to a 1:250,000 statewide coastline which did not
include many of the islands and did not match well with the 1:63,360
hydrography.  Attributes have been added to the arcs, but have not been
checked carefully.

This coverage is the first of its kind at this scale; thus there are
errors.  Please notify DNR, LRIS so these may be corrected.

Note:  The USGS is in the process of automating the hydrography statewide
at 1:63,360 and should be used as a replacement when the information is
ready.  This hydrography was not complete and available as of January
1998, and no specific date was set.</purpose>

selected where water-type = 'S'
for shoreline or 'N' for null (closing mouth of streams).  This
information was used first as it had the most logical coding for
arc attributes.  The USGS information was downloaded from the web
where holes existed.  EVOS was used to fill in also.  USFS, Chugach
was used to completely replace the Prince William Sound area.  The
statewide 1:250000 alaska coastline was used to fill in where no
other data was available.  Attributes are structured the same as the
ADNR, LRIS hydrography and were added.  The attributes were not qc'ed
